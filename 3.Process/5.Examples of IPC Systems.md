## Communication link 
1. ***physical link*** (hardware bus , network)
2. ***logical link*** (when one communicate with special one a logical link established between both ).
logical link can be : 
1. Direct & indirect 
2. Synchronous & asynchronous 
3. Automatic & buffering 

### Direct communication 
may be symmetric or asymmetric
symmetric --> both sender and receiver name each other 
send(P,message) send to process P
receive (Q,message) receive from process Q

Asymmetric --> only the sender  name the receiver process 
send(P,message)  send to process P
receive (id,message)   --> receive any message then ,write it's id

### Indirect communication 
messages are sen and receive from mailbox 

### Synchronization 
1. Blocking (Synchronous) send 
    the sending process is blocking until the receive process(direct) or mailbox (indirect)receive the message 
2. none blocking (asynchronous)send 
	the send process sending message and resume operation 
3. Blocking (Synchronous) receive 
	the receive process block until it receive the sending message 
4. none blocking (asynchronous)receive   
    the receiving process not blocking and keep receiving 
### buffering
1. Zero capacity (no buffering)
	the sender must block until the receiver receive the message 
2. Bounded capacity (automatic buffering)
	 the sender keep sending until the queue full , in this state the sender must block until the queue  has valid space
3. Unbounded capacity (automatic buffering)
	due to the large size of the queue we said that the buffer never full , so the sender never block
