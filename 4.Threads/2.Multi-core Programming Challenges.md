1. Identifying tasks -->how can we  divide process into treads 
2. Balance --> the threads doesn't talk equal execution time how to balance this 
3. Data splitting --> divide data between tasks that run on separate cores 
4. Data dependency 
5. Testing and debugging  --> testing a program with many execution paths
